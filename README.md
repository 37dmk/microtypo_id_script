microtypography script for InDesign
===================================

Based on the JSON script by Fabian Mor√≥n Zirfas, this script is supposed to do the repetitive microtypographic changes you have to do in most of the typesetted products, like changing the quotes to the typographic quotes, deleting double white spaces and replacing four and more white spaces with a tab and so on.
This script can NOT replace the eye of a good typographer, but it will certainly simplify his work.

The GREP-Code is tested and working, but i strongly recommend to save your File before running the script. (As the alert in the beginning will tell you to)

In exception of the JSON-Object coded by Mr. Zirfas, all Code is written by Lukas Schiltknecht aka 37DMK.
